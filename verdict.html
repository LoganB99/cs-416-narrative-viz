                    <h3>🎭 The 2020s: A Perfect Storm of Disruption</h3>
                    <p>
                        The 2020s have been anything but normal for the film industry. The COVID-19 pandemic 
                        fundamentally changed how people consume entertainment, with streaming services 
                        experiencing unprecedented growth while theaters struggled to recover. The SAG-AFTRA 
                        strike further disrupted production schedules and release dates, creating an 
                        artificial drought of content.

                    <h3>💰 The Streaming Revolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The rise of streaming platforms has fundamentally altered audience expectations and 
                        viewing habits. With high-quality superhero content available at home (WandaVision, 
                        The Mandalorian, The Boys), the bar for theatrical releases has been raised 
                        significantly. Movies that might have succeeded in the pre-streaming era now face 
                        tougher competition for audience attention and dollars.

                        Both major comic book studios are preparing for their biggest events yet:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Marvel Studios:</strong> Building toward "Avengers: Secret Wars" and "Avengers: Doomsday" - 
                        potentially the most ambitious crossover events in cinema history</li>
                        <li><strong>DC Studios:</strong> Rebooted with James Gunn's Superman, promising a fresh start 
                        and new creative direction</li>

                    <h3>📈 What the Data Actually Shows</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our analysis reveals that while there may be signs of audience fatigue, the data is 
                        far from conclusive. Revenue patterns show superhero films still dominate the box 
                        office, and sentiment analysis suggests quality remains relatively consistent. 
                        The "decline" we're seeing might simply be the natural ebb and flow of a maturing genre.

                    <p>
                        To truly understand if superhero fatigue is real, we need more data from a 
                        post-pandemic, post-strike world. The next few years will be crucial as:

                    <h3>🎯 The Verdict</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Superhero movie fatigue is not yet proven.</strong> What we're seeing is likely 
                        the result of unprecedented industry disruption combined with the natural evolution 
                        of a genre that's been dominant for over two decades. The true test will come in 
                        the next 3-5 years as the industry stabilizes and major events hit theaters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, the superhero genre remains one of Hollywood's most reliable and profitable 
                        storytelling formats. The question isn't whether it's dying, but how it will evolve 
                        to meet changing audience expectations in a post-pandemic world.
